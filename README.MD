# Discord Data Package Parser
An application that can parse through the discord data package onto a GUI to make it easier to read. [Learn more](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004957991-Your-Discord-Data-Package)

## Overview
This is an application that I have made using the WPF application with the [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework-runtime)  
(This does mean it is currently only compatible for windows)

## Installation
[Choose the latest release](https://github.com/genki-ai/Discord-Data-Package-Parser/releases/), and download DiscordDataPackageParser.zip. This contains the executable and all dependencies.

## How to use
Using this application should be simple.  
Start by opening the data package folder using the menu strip on the top, after that everything else is done.  

You can open messages from a channel by double clicking the channel and you can copy messages by double clicking the message

# Stuff to know
* You will notice some channels called "null", these are channels that you have left/deleted/been kicked from. These names are not saved so it can not be displayed.  

* The channels are not linked to the servers they are from, this means it would not be possible to group the server channels up.

# Planned features
* Display attachments if an image - [Not completed]
* Display emotes - [Not completed]
* Swap between light/dark theme - [Not completed]
* Filter channels and messages - [Not completed]
